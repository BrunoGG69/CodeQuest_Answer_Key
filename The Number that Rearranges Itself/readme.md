## Problem Statement
There is a special number with less than 9 digits, with which if you multiply any integer from 2 to 6 (inclusive), the product is simply a rearrangement of the digits in the original number,
i.e.
XYZ x 2 = YXZ XYZ x 3 = ZXY etc. Write a program to brute force the smallest number with this property (given that that number is less than 10^8)

## Input Format
This problem has no input.

## Constraints
1. The number must be less than 100000000
2. The number must remain a permutation of itself when multiplied by 2 through 6

## Output Format
Output a single integer â€” the smallest number with the described property.
